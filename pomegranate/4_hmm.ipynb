    "Lets take the simplified example of CG island detection on a sequence of DNA. DNA is made up of the four canonical nucleotides, abbreviated 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'. We can say that regions of the genome that are enriched for nucleotides 'C' and 'G' are 'CG islands', which is a simplification of the real biological concept but sufficient for our example. The issue with identifying these regions is that they are not exclusively made up of the nucleotides 'C' and 'G', but have some 'A's and 'T's scatted amongst them. A simple model that looked for long stretches of C's and G's would not perform well, because it would miss most of the real regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can start off by building the model. Because HMMs involve the transition matrix, which is often represented using a graph over the hidden states, building them requires a few more steps that a simple distribution or the mixture model. Our simple model will be composed of two distributions. One distribution wil be a uniform distribution across all four characters and one will have a preference for the nucleotides C and G, while still allowing the nucleotides A and T to be present."
